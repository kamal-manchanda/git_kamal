# Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. The csv for the Stack Overflow Survey is available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).

# Project Motivation
This project was done as part of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. Which type of developers does Stack Overflow have?
2. How satisfied are they with Stack Overflow?
3. What drives Stack Overflow satisfaction?

# File Descriptions
Analysis is done under jupyter notebook - Stack Overflow Users.ipynb. Notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

There is an additional .py file that runs the necessary code for cleaning the data wherever required.

# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@kmanchanda/understanding-stack-overflow-users-6dd0d4dcb6e7).

# Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
